				<h2 id='section-1'>The Project</h2>
				<h3>About Quora &amp; my role </h3>
				<p><a href='http://www.quora.com/'>Quora</a> is a question and answer platform with a mission to grow and share the world's knowledge.</p>

				<p>At Quora, we use notifications (in-product, push, and e-mail) to interact with users and make the platform feel alive. I started working on notifications when I stumbled upon it and found little standardization or principles. I was drawn to what I saw to be a messy problem area and the potential for dramatic improvement and high impact.</p>

				<p>Designers at Quora execute on everything from scoping to implementation to running A/B tests. I started by conducting user research, meeting with anyone with context and running small tests. Eventually, notifications became central to a new company strategy. As the design owner, I have been leading a team of engineers and data scientists to improve the end-to-end experience of our notifications product.</p>

				<h2 id='section-2'>The Product</h2>
				<h3>Our Solution</h3>
				<p>My work optimized <b>scannability</b>, how easily someone can go through their notifications, and <b>user trust</b> of our notifications product.</p>
				<p>Through product decisions, documentation, and thorough communication, I also built the foundation for notifications to be scalable and sustainable system. Changes we made significantly increased metrics like visits and notification clickthrough rate.</p>

				<h2 id='section-3'>The Big Picture</h2>
				<h3>Tragedy of the commons</h3>
					<p>Evaluating the current state of the system, I took stock of the product from the user, design, and system angles.</p>					
					<ol>
						<li>User mental models</li>
						<p>Quarterly state of the product surveys showed that users found notifications to be irrelevant, excessive, and sometimes confusing. I conducted card sorting exercises with users to get a deeper understanding and learned of the nuance that users approach different channel, for example, push and SMS are highly intrusive and long form content is not only suited for, but preferred, on email.</p>

						<li>Visual design</li>
						<p>After some years of neglect, notifications lacked any sort of consistency. Looking first at in-product and push notifications specifically, I saw inconsistent styling, unpredictable formatting, and wide variation across platforms.</p>		

						<li>State of the system</li>
						<p>Notifications had no check and balances in place and as teams created new more over time, they grew increasingly inconsistent and unscalable. Our existing system had an immature heuristic around send decision as well as insight into the system health when adding new notification types.</p>
					</ol>

				<h2 id='section-5'>Scannability</h2>				
				<p>Notifications should give users an overview of what has been happening around the product in just a few seconds. To bring our notifications closer to this ideal, I focused on bringing consistency, distinct visual hierarchy, and clear messaging into the product so that people could parse through a large volume of notifications and and decide which to engage with.</p>

				<h3>Building systems</h3>	
				<p>Systems are built from patterns, so I looked for ways to standardize similarities across the 160+ types of notifications and set rules for where I found discrepancies. To highlight a few decisions, I</p>
				<ul>
					<li>defined a template consisting of a context (the source), title (the main message), body (supporting information) and preview (content snippet)</li>
					<li>distinguished user generated content from system copy</li>
					<li>used active voice, except for punitive moderation messages where we want to focus on the action rather than the actor</li>
					<li>standardized product language to reduce variation and confusion</li>
					<li>put away non-primary actions, to reduce bias between notifications and resolve internationalization compatibility</li>
					<li>removed embedded links to make clickthroughs more predictable</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>Categorization</h3>
				<p>I categorized notifications to create more structure in the system. The aforementioned card sorting exercise showed that people naturally grouped notifications by intent and product area, a grouping that also worked well our internal organization. I set 11 main categories to be used for push notification groups, in-product notification filters, and icon badges.</p>

				<h2 id='section-5'>Establishing user trust</h2>				
				<p>Trust is important for brand integrity and downstream engagement. When it comes to building trust via notifications, it comes down do deciding what to send and finessing that packaging experience.</p>

				<h3>Deciding what to send</h3>	
				<p>We leveraged machine learning and manual user opt out to make notification send decisions.</p>
				<p>ML was our solution on how to make trade-offs between different notifications and protect the product from user unsubscribes. Our initial ML model naively optimized for notification clickthrough rate. To garner more signal, we let users give feedback via a per notification negative action and a random survey on push notification clickthrough. These signals both helped show users that we cared about their experience and gather a significant volume of responses to further train our model. </p>
				<p>Because machine learning can only do so much, we also let users explicitly opt in and out of notifications. To make users feel in control of sensitive channels like push and e-mail, we</p>
				<ul>
					<li>made the settings page easier to access, providing a settings link directly in the notifications page</li>
					<li>incorporated above-mentioned categories and icons into the settings page for easy discovery</li>
					<li>mirrored notification copy to the setting description to improve user opt-out accuracy</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>Packaging experience</h3>
				<p>The packaging experience covers the how the user receives a notification. I looked at message hierarchy, clickthrough destination, actions, and badging.</p>
				<p>Trust starts with not misleading our users, so I reworked notification titles to always be the main message. Notifications that describe a transaction, like an upvote, have a title describing the transaction itself. Notifications that engage people by pushing content have a content focused title.</p>

				<p>Notifications are windows to different parts of the product and have clickthrough destinations and actions. I wanted the clickthrough experiences to always take users to the origin of the referenced content, so I audited updated all dead-ends. Aggregated notifications, where we combine notifications of the same type (e.g. 2 upvotes on an answer), no longer clicked through to a summary page with the disparate notifications, and instead clicked through to a product page with an injected bundle of relevant notification information.</p>

				<p>An audit showed that very few buttons in notifications were direct call to actions. I removed most inline buttons to reduce bias and cannibalization between notifications and introduced an overflow menu to house secondary actions. Despite being less discoverable, the overflow menu standardized the placement of actions and didn’t result in any action drops.</p>

				<p>Badging lets people know there are notifications waiting for them. Existing badging logic and behavior was very confusing and arbitrary, especially for our users in multiple language silos. Regardless of the existing state, I decided that badging had to feel intuitive and feel deliberate. We</p>
				<ul>
					<li>made every notification equate to a single badge count rather than aggregating or bundling counts</li>
					<li>unified notification pages across all silos into a single universal page</li>
					<li>re-introduced our home page digest element as an in-product notification, moving the badge count from our home feed to our notifications page and also unifying the digest element across app, mobile web, and desktop</li>
					<li>preserved the red number badge UI for areas that badged the app</li>

				<h2 id='section-5'>Setting the stage for uniformity & sustainability</h2>
				<h3>Visual Design</h3>	
				<p>To set the stage for sustainability of the updated notifications systems, I assembled documentation around all past work, known challenges, updated product principles, and proposed ideas. I also assembled a design checklist for any new or changes to existing notifications.</p>
				<p>Documentation only helps to the extent that someone is willing to read through it. Product decisions were made to benefit both the user and our process. For example, using a single categorization system across push notification groupings, settings page, iconography, and in-product notification filters is easier for designers and developers work with than a system per dimension.</p>
				<p>Last but not least, I took advantage of any platforms I could to keep notifications relevant. From discussions on deprecating product areas to changing product language, I bring up and slate work for relevant notification considerations. In doing so, others will also start to consider notifications and the upkeep will spread from just my team to other teams.</p>

				<p>The work done until now is only the tip of the iceberg. Future areas of work include </p>
				<ul>
					<li>more iteration and nuance discovery around the notification copy </li>
					<li>unique considerations in notification units and the notification page for product areas like Spaces, Partners, moderation, and Ads</li>
