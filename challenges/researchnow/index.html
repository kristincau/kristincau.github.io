				<h2 id='section-1'>Understanding the Space</h2>
				<h3>Background Research</h3>
				<p>My first concern was to understand my audience, the Market Researcher, and their environment. Given the project constraints, I used internet sources (<a href='http://www.greenbookblog.org/2015/06/26/the-top-10-challenges-in-the-market-research-industry/'>GreenBook Blog</a>, <a href='http://www.dobney.com/Research/MR_basics.htm'>dobney.com</a>, <a href='https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/market-research-surveys/'>SurveyMonkey</a>). A full scale project, however, should include user interviews and user testing at each stage for more comprehensive user research.</p>

				<p>I specifically researched what were the goals of a market researcher, what similar products exist currently, as well as what were common pain points and problems behind current market research survey tactics. I was naturally led to more questions from what I learned, which helped me to outline constraints. </p>

				<h3>Goals</h3>
				<p>I specifically researched what were the goals of a market researcher, what similar products exist currently, as well as what were common pain points and problems behind current market research survey tactics. I was naturally led to more questions from what I learned, which helped me to outline constraints. </p>

				<h2 id='section-3'>Ideation and Exploration</h2>
				<h3>Storyboarding</h3>
				<p>With a goal in mind, I began hashing out the different ways that a survey creation tool could be made. My ideas ranged from a hand-holding wizard format, to a very free form What-You-See-Is-What-You-Get (WYIWYG) interface.</p>					

			</div>
		</div>

		<div class='row row__img'>
			<div class='col-xs-12'>

		</div>	

		<div class='row'>		
			<div class='project__body col-xs-12 col-sm-10 col-sm-offset-1 col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2'>				
				<p>For each of my ideas, I reflected on how well each solution addressed the goals. From there, I iterated on my ideas and opted for a more integrated approach. The free-form nature of the WYSIWYG was good because it made the tool scalable, but its lack of guidance didnâ€™t prevent from a poorly constructed survey. To compensate, I decided to add two key elements: survey templates and a community review system. </p>		
			</div>

		<div class='row'>		
			<div class='project__body col-xs-12 col-sm-10 col-sm-offset-1 col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2'>				
				<p>Templates were necessary to provide some sort of fool-proof base for Market Researchers to work from. Another bonus was that it could potentially save a Market Researcher time, rather then having them to create a survey from scratch every time.</p>
				<p>The community review system was my solution to providing lower cost survey validation. While a solution like an AI that checks for bias or unclear cultural context sounds exciting, the technology required would increase cost of the tool, undermining the purpose of a survey as earlier mentioned. </p>		

				<h2 id='section-4'>Hashing out Details</h2>
				<h3>User Flows &amp; Interaction Design</h3>
				<p>Before creating wireframes, I took and intermediary step to ideate some interaction flows. I focused my efforts and solutions on the actual WYSIWYG for survey creation. I drew my final solution by iterating and combining on a few of my initial ideas. My key values here were to make the interface an intuitive representation of the actual survey. Like the actual survey, the interface would separate the survey pages. To remove the need for a clunky toolbar, I decided to have separate controls relative to each question/answer set. </p>

				<h2 id='section-5'>A Solution</h2>
				<h3>Wireframes</h3>	
				<p>The final solution is a single page application. I decided on a SPA  to reduce complexity and place emphasis on survey creation.  The main navigation sits on the left of the screen and focuses on navigation between multiple surveys. Other navigational areas include a community page and settings, both of which I do not explore in this design solution.</p>
				<p>The survey creation tool consists of four parts: the survey itself, survey settings and details, reviews of the survey from the community, and data gathered from the survey. </p>

				<h3>New Empty State Survey</h3>
				<p>Users are greeted with this page when creating a new survey.</p>
					<li>Explore Community Navigation</li>
					<p>Takes user to the Community area of the application which I do not explore in this solution. The Community area would allow users to view and provide feedback on surveys created by other users.</p>	
					<li>Survey Templates</li>		
					<p>Users are provided with templates, as well as the option to not use a template, if no work has been done to start a new survey.</p>
					<li>Save Draft vs. Publish</li>		
					<p>Surveys have two modes, Draft and Published (or Live). Depending on the mode, certain functionalities are available.</p>
					<li>Sharing Link</li>		
					<p>A sharing link only becomes available when a survey has been at least saved as a Draft.</p>
					<li>Data and Reviews</li>		
					<p>These two elements are combined as one is only applicable based on a given mode. Data represents data gathered from a Published survey, and Reviews represent commentary and feedback from the Community when a survey is still a Draft.</p>

				</br></br></br>
				<h3>Survey (Draft)</h3>
				<p>A survey is a Draft before it is Published. Surveys can only be edited when it is a Draft.</p>

					<li>Editing Pages</li>
					<p>Pages represent how survey questions are organized in a survey. Pages can be named, re-ordered and deleted.</p>	
					<li>Community Reviews</li>		
					<p>While a survey is a Draft, it can be reviewed by the Community. If a Market Researcher does not want reviews, this option can be turned off.</p>
					<li>Viewing Community Feedback</li>		
					<p>Other users can give inline feedback about specific questions and answers in a Survey. </p>
					<li>Page Skip Logic</li>		
					<p>If a question requires logic, a user enable page skip logic. Each answer can lead to a specific page.</p>

				</br></br></br>
				<h3>Survey (Published)</h3>
				<p>A survey is Live after it is Published. Surveys can begin gathering data.</p>
					<li>Live Survey</li>
					<p>Surveys that are Live, or Published, have a tag indicating so.</p>	
					<li>Button States</li>		
					<p>Once a survey has been Published, it cannot be Published again. It can, however, be Unpublished which will revert the survey into Draft mode.</p>
					<li>Disabled Community Reviews</li>		
					<p>Community reviews cannot be made while a survey is Live.</p>
					<li>Data Analytics</li>		
					<p>Market Researchers can see the data that has been gathered by a survey up until that given time. They can choose to view the data in a more comprehensive view. This is not covered in this design solution.</p>
